    Hi! My name is Fumiko Guisinga, I am 14 years old and I am from Panabo City. I stay in the Girl's Dormitory during the weekdays
    due to distance from my home. During the weekends, my dad picks me up to go home. I spend my free time playing sports, making art, 
    dancing, writing, travelling and watching films. I am a loud and extroverted person because I also came from a family who
    are people-persons. I hope to work in the medical field someday.
